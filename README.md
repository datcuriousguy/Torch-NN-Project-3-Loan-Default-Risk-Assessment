# Torch-NN-Project-3-Loan-Default-Risk-Assessment
This project focuses on automating loan default prediction in a banking environment using AI. We developed a neural network with PyTorch that analyzes applicant data to estimate the probability of default. The model outputs either a probability score or a binary decision to support efficient and scalable loan approval processes.
